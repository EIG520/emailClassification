# Files

## train.py
Trains the network on the dataset (you don't have to run this since it's pretrained)
## bench.py 
Benchmarks the network (you also don't have to run this since I benched it, but you can if you want to know the accuracy)
## main.py
Classifies whether it thinks the email in "email.txt" is spam or not.
## everything.py
Is essentially train and bench combined, except it does everything worse so don't use it
