train.py - Trains the network on the dataset (you don't have to run this since it's pretrained)\n
bench.py - Benchmarks the network (you also don't have to run this since I benched it, but you can if you want to know the accuracy)\n
main.py - Classifies whether it thinks the email in "email.txt" is spam or not.\n
everything.py - Is essentially train and bench combined, except it does everything worse so don't use it\n
